## What is Oaysus?

Oaysus is a visual page builder platform that enables:

1. **Developers** to build reusable components in React, Vue, or Svelte
2. **Marketing teams** to create and edit pages visually without code
3. **Fast deployment** with pre-rendered pages served from global edge servers

The CLI is the developer's primary interface for building and pushing components to Oaysus.
